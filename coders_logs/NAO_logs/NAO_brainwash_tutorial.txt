What's up guys today I will show you how to deal with a naughty NAO that is acting up (even more than usual). Let's get started!!

If all else fails, you basically need to reinstall the NAO's operating system fully (see below how). Before that, you can try this:

if nao gets unresponsive: 
- connect robot to router with ethernet cable
- ping it
- open Robot Settings
- change network settings of the robot to connect it to network with internet access (not eduroam)

!!! this took it back to a 'normal' function mode

- connect to network with internet access (not eduroam)
- press front button to get ip 
- ping it 
- connect to the robot with choreographe
- advanced connection -> update robot system -> upload .opn file
- reboot as indicated


IF NOTHING SEEMS TO WORK:

## 1 Find the .opn file online, and download it

## 2 get the NAO flasher:

## 3 Follow the steps on this site to flash the NAO:

NOTE:
Run the flasher app as admin, and when prompted you should probably select factory reset if you want to be sure the flashing will fix the Nao. I guess if you don't want to lose settings, you can try without the factory reset, I haven't tried but maybe that's enough to fix the issue as well.

Also on the same site it tells you how to clean a formatted USB stick, which you need to do before using it for the flashing:
